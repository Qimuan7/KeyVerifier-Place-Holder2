# [NOTICE]
## THIS IS NOT MY WORK, IT'S SOURCE FROM => https://github.com/daboynb/Safetycore-placeholder
## So if you like this app, plz give him all the praise！

# [What it use for?]
It is an empty installation package that replaces the KeyVerifier App automatically downloaded by PlayStore.
You only need to uninstall KeyVerifier and install this replace pkg, then PlayStore will refuse to install it(Google's KeyVerifier) anymore because the package name is the same but the signature and version do not match.

## (this app only for key-verifier, if you wanna replace safety-core, check here => https://github.com/daboynb/Safetycore-placeholder/releases)

Android System KeyVerifier:

# [Why i create this? & Why not fork? Why named Holder"2"? ...]
For me, I just don't like the fact that PlayStore installs these two apps on any of my Android devices without my permission. They don't seem to be of much use to me, but will increase battery consumption and memory usage :(.

I feel like I should apologize because I don't know how to use GitHub, but I saw that changing files after forking seemed to affect the main repository of my fork (not my own repository), so to avoid causing trouble for that developer(@daboynb), I created a new repository.

If it infringes your rights, please tell me and I will delete it immediately (if I see the notification in time). In addition, I will only install it on my own devices and share it with users in need. I will not do anything else.

Please forgive my unfamiliarity with Android Studio (so I simply changed the package name), so the app's size is significantly larger than the original. I'm unsure how to reduce it, so for the sake of proper installation, I decided to leave it as is.

If you installed it for the sake of size, you might be disappointed (it takes up over 1.50MB), but the good news is that it's still significantly smaller than KeyVerifier (17MB+ => 1.5MB+).

# [Finally]
Anyway, have a good day and wish you happy ^^
